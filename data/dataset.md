P.S. refer to data set from this drive ( [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gHou49cA1s5vua2V5L98Lt8TiWA3FrKB](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gHou49cA1s5vua2V5L98Lt8TiWA3FrKB) ) only .h5 files required, so 6 files to be downloaded ( 2 from each training, validating and testing ). Such files can't be uploaded on github as the transfer limit is 25MB.
